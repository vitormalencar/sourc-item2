## Why it's awesome

this is a personal project, I do like to code at night and I do think that those colors are nice =)
we have a long way to go but it only starts with the fist commit right ?!

## Install

1) Download the sourc.itermcolors from this repo
2) on Item2 config  under profile > colors import the `sourc.itemcolors`
